# AI-Powered Blind Navigation Assistance  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered navigation assistance system** designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely using **YOLO object detection** and **real-time audio alerts**. It detects objects, estimates their distance, and provides verbal guidance to users about obstacles in their path.  

## 🎯 Features  
- **Real-time object detection** using YOLOv8  
- **Distance estimation** for obstacle avoidance  
- **Audio alerts** using text-to-speech (TTS)  
- **Direction guidance** (Left, Center, Right)  
- **Dynamic alerts** based on object distance  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **YOLOv8** - Object detection  
- **OpenCV** - Video processing  
- **Pyttsx3** - Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
- **Python** - Core programming language  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:
